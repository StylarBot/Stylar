# Stylar has moved!

üõë Notice: The JS version of Stylar has and will no longer be recieving updates regularly. We will instead switch to [Typescript](https://github.com/StylarBot/Stylar-TS) version of Stylar which is 10x easier for us to manage, code, and much more. It will be now recieving more frequant updates and new features whilst the OG Stylar will be retiring. Thank you for the support, and enjoy something more clear and easier to read and update with us!
